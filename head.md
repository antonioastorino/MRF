# MRF - Make readme file

This project aims at creating a README.md file by means of the shell `makeReadme.sh`. It is not intended to be a professional tool but a simple script for projects of any size where a single README.md file is needed. Nevertheless, due to its intrinsic simplicity, it is easily customizable.

I use this script in all my C/C++ project.
